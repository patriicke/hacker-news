A few years back, lots of new cannabinoids and cathinones were getting released constantly as older analogs were getting banned. Often, these novel analogs are pharmacological low hanging fruit. The drug in this article is also such low-hanging fruit: it is well known an N-methyl to N-ethyl substitution does not lead to reduced activity in this category of arylcyclohexylamine dissociative anesthetics (this was actually one of the SAR considerations taken by the designers of methoxetamine!). And indeed, this very same substitution was used here on 2-Fluorodeschloroketamine, leading to the drug from the article.<p>PS the Chinese abbreviation for &quot;CanKet&quot;, 2F-NENDCK, most likely stands for 2-fluoro-N-ethyl-nordeschloroketamine.

Writing to a file copies data from our user space buffer to the kernel buffer and returns immediately. At some later point in time the kernel will send it to the disk. A regular file is hence always ready for writing and epoll wouldn’t add anything.<p>Is that true? If it would be, the amount of data the Kernel would need to buffer is unbounded. I assumed there is a limit on the amount of buffered and not yet committed data, and when that is cross the call would block until more data is flushed to disk. Which is kind of the same as happens for TCP sockets.

Instead, block (mask) the signal, set a signal handler, and use epoll_pwait() to atomically unblock it while you wait for events. Note that in this setup, your signal handler callback need not be async-signal-safe, since you know the precise state of the calling thread: it&#x27;s invoking epoll_pwait(). This sidesteps most of the pain of using signals which might otherwise make you think you want signalfd.<p>Two reasons not to use signalfd:<p>1. signalfd has weird semantics that don&#x27;t match what you&#x27;d normally expect from a file descriptor. When you read from a signalfd, it tells you signals queued on the thread that called read(), NOT the thread that created the signalfd. Worse, if you add signalfd to an epoll, the epoll will report readiness based on the thread that used epoll_ctl() to add the signalfd, which may be different from the thread that is reading from the epoll. So you might get a notification that the signalfd is ready, but then read the signalfd and find there are no signals, and then wait on the epoll again just to have it tell you again that this signalfd is ready.<p>2. It turns out that signalfd&#x27;s implementation has some severe lock contention issues. I learned this through my own experimentation recently. In my experiment, I had 5000 threads each waiting on an epoll that included a signalfd. When delivering a thread-specific signal to each of the 5000 threads at once, the process spent 2+ MINUTES of CPU time spinning on spinlocks in the kernel before completing all the event deliveries. The time spent was O(n^2) to the number of threads. When I switched to an epoll_pwait()-based implementation, the same task took a few milliseconds.<p>Here&#x27;s the PR where I switched KJ&#x27;s event loop (used in Cap&#x27;n Proto and Cloudflare Workers) to use epoll_pwait(): <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;capnproto&#x2F;capnproto&#x2F;pull&#x2F;1511\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;capnproto&#x2F;capnproto&#x2F;pull&#x2F;1511</a>','1666463885','comment','2022-10-28 14:31:55','2022-10-28 14:31:55'),(33301043,'sylware','[33304459]',NULL,33299650,'I wrote many of my own programs on elf&#x2F;linux: I do epoll as much as I can.<p>The only troubling thingy is the lack of classification of signals, those who are synchronous by nature and the other ones.

Sometimes you can slip through the ground and the water, and all other barriers become passable.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;YDyJa5g.png\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;YDyJa5g.png</a><p>(edit: It might be related to hitting slightly awkward terrain?)<p>(edit 2: Got it on video, though my commentary didn&#x27;t get recorded for some reason)  <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=f7U-qS7P2tI\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=f7U-qS7P2tI</a>','1666554122','comment','2022-10-28 14:40:26','2022-10-28 14:40:26'),(33309653,'jph',NULL,NULL,33307059,'Excellent writeup thank you.

The farmer owning it converted a bit in the middle into residential building plots, a road was built, electricity hooked up etc. Most of the people that buy those plots do it as an investment so they don&#x27;t do anything to them. I have observed over last 10 years how nature took over those plots. Hay that grows and is not mowed accumulates and besides being a fire hazard provides an environment for birds to nest in. Wild trees have grown to the point one wouldn&#x27;t recognise it was a field a decade ago. I regularly have hedgehogs, hares, deer, lots of all kinds of birds (including a golden Eagle once).

But I&#x27;ll return to that in a moment.<p>We live in a complex system, so we can blame the political&#x2F;financial system for providing wrong incentives, loans and subsidies to the big agriculture, based on profitability alone.<p>We can blame agriculture companies for sprayng millions of tons of poisons all over our countryside to keep profits up and costs down. When you&#x27;re planting monocrops, and spraying it with pesti&#x2F;herbicides, you&#x27;re propagating environmental equivalents of deserts. Deserts leaking poisons not only on itself, but through whole nature (through wind &amp; water cycle).<p>Both pesticides and herbicides are inbelievably poisonous not only to plants and pests, but also to other bugs (we all know at least about bees), to all other animals, the animals we feed with the produce, and in the end, even to humans. Those poisons&#x27; bioaccumulate and their neurodegenerative and hormons-altering effects are causing havoc not only in bugs, frogs and mice, but also in humans (parkinson, etc.).<p>The solution is something we&#x27;re actively killing with our current agricultural practices. Biodiversity.<p>For example, we don&#x27;t need to kill the mice with poisons. We can interplant trees into our fields to provide living space for predators (e.g. owls and foxes) to manage the mice population and not use the poisons to keep those predators alive.<p>We can&#x27;t reasonably expect the return of an army of small farmers, providing local communities with poison-free grown food, not in a reasonable time frame we have until environmental collapse and&#x2F;or extinction of key animal kinds (no pollinators, no birds, no small predators, more mice, more bad bugs and diseases, famines ...).<p>But what we can do, we can change our habits. We don&#x27;t have to eat meat&#x2F;dairy, which is incredibly land&#x2F;resource&#x2F;poison intensive (we would need 4+ earths to feed the world&#x27;s population same diet as americans have). We don&#x27;t have to feed other animal 20x more food than we would need only to eat its muscles. We don&#x27;t have to cut down forests to grow meat (we would need 1&#x2F;4 of the land to feed the population if everybody were to switch to a plant based diet), if we eat the plants ourselves and let the nature be and let it repair itself.<p>We can then change the political&#x2F;financial&#x2F;agricultural system through our own actions (buying&#x2F;cooking&#x2F;eating). When enough people do, there won&#x27;t be the pressure to produce a much as we currently do, then we can legislate the change in the agriculture , forbid use of poisons, protect the ecosystems, reforest the earth, live in sync with the nature, stop exploiting everything (and living beings) with our need for financial gains.<p>Sorry for my bad english.

I&#x27;ve been hiking the forests here multiple times per week for 20 years. You can clearly see how some groups are disappearing whilst others remain.<p>There&#x27;s several root causes but the primary one is a lack of native plant diversity. Since agriculture over here is done in close proximity to forests, the soil becomes acid due to the nitrogen disposition. This benefits the growth of a handful of plants at the expense of all others. In some of our forests, the soil is now so acid that snails no longer develop a case and bird eggs collapse.<p>In this plant monoculture, insects depending on a specific host plant disappear. Outside (protected) forests, things aren&#x27;t much better. Even the tiniest of strips of grass that would normally produce wildflowers, are aggressively mowed down. People&#x27;s gardens are designed to be as hostile to insects as is possible.<p>Secondary reasons are invasive species and light pollution.<p>It&#x27;s a sad state of affairs and one we should be deeply ashamed of.

He worked in finance most of his career so he was working with computers fairly early on and throughout most of his career.  We had a home PC by 1989, and he spent a lot of time in the 90s messing with DOS and Windows 95 and programming with C as a hobby.<p>These days he has an iPhone and iPad that I got him because of accessibility and ease of use, a Windows PC, and a Roku (he used the Hulu local tv service instead of cable).  On all of those devices he can only do the basics and is completely helpless if something unexpected happens. Just a few days ago he was watching a show on Prime Video, accidentally skipped to the next episode, and couldn’t figure out how to navigate back.  On his iDevices he routinely gets confused trying trying to look at messages, i think because he’s used to seeing&#x2F;answering them through notifications and doesn’t understand the layout of the messages app.  He also has a lot of frustration with the iDevices due to arthritis in his hands. On his PC he’s been using Quicken to track his finances for probably two decades, and last year he ask me to help set up online download of his accounts to make the reconciliation easier.  I thought it was a good idea at the time, but every month or two now I have to sit down with him and spend an hour unravelling a mess he created due to getting confused about Quicken’s process for matching downloaded transactions with those he manually entered in the register.<p>I could go on and on with examples, but the question I ponder over is whether or not there’s a fundamental difference between his generation that didn’t grow up with technology and the younger generations that did.  Will technology move on and change so that even those of us who a tech savvy today are hopelessly outclassed in 30-40 years?  Or are have our brains been wired differently to make us more adaptable?  I don’t have answers and I’m rambling at this point, but I feel like something has to give.

Yet many core economic activities—such as uncollateralized lending and building personal brands—are built on persistent, non-transferable relationships. In this paper, we illustrate how non-transferable “soulbound” tokens (SBTs) representing the commitments, credentials, and affiliations of “Souls” can encode the trust networks of the real economy to establish provenance and reputation. More importantly, SBTs enable other applications of increasing ambition, such as community wallet recovery, sybil-resistant governance, mechanisms for decentralization, and novel markets with decomposable, shared rights. We call this richer, pluralistic ecosystem “Decentralized Society” (DeSoc)—a co-determined sociality, where Souls and communities come together bottom-up, as emergent properties of each other to co-create plural network goods and intelligences, at a range of scales. Key to this sociality is decomposable property rights and enhanced governance mechanisms—such as quadratic funding discounted by correlation scores—that reward trust and cooperation while protecting networks from capture, extraction, and domination. With such augmented sociality, web3 can eschew today’s hyper-financialization in favor of a more transformative, pluralist future of increasing returns across social distance.\n&quot;&quot;&quot;<p>Here&#x27;s the paper: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;papers.ssrn.com&#x2F;sol3&#x2F;papers.cfm?abstract_id=4105763\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;papers.ssrn.com&#x2F;sol3&#x2F;papers.cfm?abstract_id=4105763</a>','1666626413','comment','2022-10-28 16:16:22','2022-10-28 16:16:22'),(33318305,'SpaceManNabs',NULL,NULL,33314291,'I stopped using Windows because I was tired of Windows doing updates &#x2F; telemetrics without my control when I was playing games or waiting for code to run over night.

On the one hand you have the classic goldbug that insists that gold has &quot;intrinsic value&quot;, which is some sort of platonic ideal thing that gold simply ambiently has and defies any attempt to nail down what it grounds out in. On the other hand you have cryptocurrency advocates claiming that all value is arbitrary and&#x2F;or based entirely on scarcity. In that context, observing that my kid&#x27;s doodles are scarce but not valuable is not a cute tweet; it is a complete and utter demolishing of the argument.<p>(I think one of the things education can accidentally (mis)teach is that short arguments are always worthless and arguments must always be long. This is false. A good grounding in mathematics can help with internalizing this. It is completely possible to demolish entire massive argument edifices in 10-20 of the correct words, and the fact that the &quot;other side&quot; has deployed literally hundreds of thousands of words does not make them right if the foundation is rotten.)<p>Value is intrinsically a dynamic process. It grounds out in human desires, which are intrinsically temporal, variable, and fickle, and this makes a <i>lot</i> of people uncomfortable as they seek either a more solid <i>or</i> a more completely ethereal&#x2F;arbitrary base. However, there is no other sensible way to think about value, however complex and ever-shifting this may be, and it is neither mathematically solid, nor an amorphous vapor of no consequence subject to one strong person&#x27;s Nietzschian will.','1666628926','comment','2022-10-28 15:05:17','2022-10-28 15:05:17'),(33318912,'omar_alt',NULL,NULL,33314291,'As much as I appreciate my x220’s god knows what they would be like if I hadn’t replaced the stock OS.

It relies on later stages to do things like convert to native values or remove whitespace. As such an intermediary can&#x27;t really &quot;understand&quot; the document very well. E.g., if you are using this syntax to express key&#x2F;value then you can only know the keys if you know the whitespace rules that will be used to interpret the keys.<p>2. It reminds me more of XML than S-Expressions. If you are familiar with the ElementTree [1] representation of XML then these parsed examples become more familiar, just a prefix instead of suffix, and no attribute children.<p>3. Connecting whitespace and XML, I suppose this explains why so many XML formats ended up only using attributes for text values, and used tags and children only for nesting. Otherwise interpretation requires understanding how to interpret these mixed documents with unclear whitespace rules. But Jevko doesn&#x27;t have attributes.<p>4. If an intermediary can&#x27;t understand it then why define a syntax at all?<p>5. I don&#x27;t see any escaping rules so including literal [] seems... impossible? You can essentially deserialize the parsed value to reintroduce them, but that&#x27;s weird and awkward, and only works with balanced brackets anyway.<p>6. No way to embed binary data, or otherwise uninterpreted data. JSON has the same problem. Base64 encoding things is yet another way in which the data is not interpretable by intermediaries.<p>I think XML shows that &quot;just strings&quot; isn&#x27;t fatal, and lots of things get jammed into strings in JSON too, you&#x27;ll never be able to reproduce every type in a general purpose serialization format (I guess XML with namespaces attempted, but also clearly failed).

Although the &quot;Gaia Hypothesis&quot; ended up having a few fatal flaws, it stimulated a lot of thinking and discussion in the field of earth system sciences (atmospheric chemists were a lot more interested than old-school geologists and evolutionary biologists, certainly).  Much of what Lovelock pointed to can also be viewed as simple chemical and physical <i>buffering</i>, for example the fact that the a pH-buffered chemical solution responds to the addition of acid in a manner that &#x27;pushes back&#x27; against increasing acidity.  Likewise, a planet with an ocean buffers temperature changes because the oceans can absorb and release heat in response to external forcing.  Biological systems can do the same (forests buffer erosion, for example) but this isn&#x27;t necessarily <i>selected</i> by evolution, it&#x27;s just a feature of the biologicol-chemical-physical system.  Ultimately, the success or failure of an individual species in a forest (due to natural selection) doesn&#x27;t have much effect on the effects of a forest on the local climate, say.<p>All in all it was a bit of a spiritual-mystical &#x27;Earth Mother Loves You&#x27; theme, which is nice but nature really isn&#x27;t all that forgiving, as it&#x27;s clear we can tip the climate system into a new mode, one which some forms of life will not have problems with, but which may drive quite a few others towards extinction.<p>Also, the article mentions his discovery of low levels of chlorinated and fluorinated organic compounds in the atmosphere with his improved detector, it fails to mention that Lovelock also stated at the time that they posed no environmental threat, due to their great stability.  This isn&#x27;t too surprising, as the chemistry that led to the release of the halogens into the stratosphere, where they destroyed the UV-protective stratospheric ozone layer, is fairly complex and unusual (ice crystal surfaces playing a big role over polar regions, radical reactions, etc.).<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;17778601&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov&#x2F;17778601&#x2F;</a><p>Free Radicals Within the Antarctic Vortex: The Role of CFCs in Antarctic Ozone Loss (1991)<p>There&#x27;s no doubt, however, that Lovelock made many people think about interconnections between apparently unrelated systems and that alone was a huge lifetime success story.

href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;noloco.io\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;noloco.io</a>), a no-code platform for teams to create internal tools from their business data.<p>Noloco lets you create internal apps from data sources like PostgreSQL, Airtable and Google Sheets without writing any code. This makes building internal tools and configuring views a lot faster than building them with code and SQL queries. It also enables non-technical team members like those in ops, customer support or sales to make changes without having to rely on engineers.<p>Building internal tools is time-consuming and resource intensive, not just for the original build but the ongoing maintenance as well. It’s also not the kind of work that developers typically want to do, nor usually the most valuable use of their time.<p>From our prior experience at tech companies like HubSpot, TripAdvisor, Revolut and Flipdish, we experienced some of the pains around internal tooling first hand. As a PM leading the Payments team in one company, Simon would have to prepare SQL scripts every week to update customer data, and hound developers to run them. Most of the time, businesses simply didn’t have the resources to invest in updating tooling.<p>Since launching in November 2021, we have a wide variety of customers using Noloco for internal tools. For example, one real estate company is using Noloco to manage payment approvals to contractors hired across their property portfolio. An accounting firm uses Noloco as an internal practice management tool to keep track of proposals made to clients and relevant pieces of work. And a lead generation business used Noloco to build a sophisticated CRM and customer portal to track leads provided to their customers.<p>Most platforms that enable building internal tools are either targeted at developers, or are ‘low-code’ and still require some coding expertise to build something useful. Other no-code platforms typically connect to more no-code backends like Google Sheets and often focus more on B2C use cases, enabling building of publicly accessible websites, for example. Often these solutions fall short when it comes to building sophisticated internal tools around data.<p>Noloco is a fully no-code solution focused solely on web apps. We connect to relational databases like PostgreSQL as well as no-code backends like Airtable and Google Sheets, enabling companies to build powerful apps on top of their existing business data from multiple sources. We believe that we’ve got the balance right between simplicity and enhanced configuration ability for power users who want to go deep with customisation: filtering, validation rules, database permission rules etc.<p>It took us a couple of pivots to arrive at this system. Initially we were building a feature-rich full-stack website and web app builder—but no one could build anything useful with it. We decided to revamp the product to make it much simpler. A few weeks later, we had our first version of our client portal builder. This was a step in the right direction, but our value proposition around centralising customer interactions in a custom-made client portal wasn’t resonating with prospects. Finally we realized that what our most successful customers wanted was to share their existing data with their team or customers. This led us to revamp the product once more to make the focus on connecting your existing data. Once you do so, we’re able to automatically build an app around your data meaning that you can launch a whole lot faster with much less of a learning curve.<p>The starting point for building an app with Noloco is adding data. If using an external data source like Airtable or Postgres, you provide your connection details, choose what tables you want to import and then Noloco syncs your data across.  Once the initial import has finished, Noloco instantly builds an app for you around your data—including collections, forms and record pages for each database record. From there, you can customise the app and select the most appropriate layout options to display your data like tables, kanban boards, calendars and charts.<p>You can set database permissions by user role to control what records different users have access to and what fields they can view and edit. This means that you can confidently invite your team or customers and allow them to view, create and update data.<p>In case you’re interested, here’s a video of us building a Lending App from Postgres data:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=CVDHCvPqgsg\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=CVDHCvPqgsg</a><p>If you’re interested in trying the product, we recently launched our free tier and you get a free trial of all premium features when you sign up.

Daniel here, I’m a software engineer and hobbyist hacker. I’m joined by my cofounder Matt. We’re building Paigo (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;paigo.tech\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;paigo.tech</a>). We make it easy for SaaS businesses to bill customers based on usage.<p>To get your hands dirty a bit we have a stateless and signupless demo you can try out: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hn.paigo.tech&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hn.paigo.tech&#x2F;</a> and a video of me walking through the system in a bit more detail: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;T6J1Yh8GhdU\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;T6J1Yh8GhdU</a>.<p>The idea of our platform is fairly straightforward: You give us read-only access to your SaaS backend and based on tenant metadata for your infrastructure, we measure, persist, and aggregate SaaS tenant usage data to give a clear picture of per-client usage. We can measure metrics like API requests, Compute time, Data Storage, Transaction Volumes and many more. Some common scenarios would be: an ML platform could use Paigo to track processed input files for customers, a Data platform could use Paigo to determine the data size customers have consumed, and an API company can use Paigo to track customers’ API requests. Additionally, we also help you understand your cost to serve your clients’ usage, and this data allows us to provide your SaaS with usage based billing.<p>What’s the problem we are solving? Many SaaS products need to measure their customer&#x27;s usage in some form, and many want to incorporate it into their billing plans. It’s fairly annoying to either build the entire system in house or to build a measurement system in house and then connect to a billing provider. It takes months to get a usage based billing system up and running and usually requires several engineers (if not more) to maintain and operate. Also, when Sales wants to offer specific discounts or deals to major enterprises, it’s typically handled outside of the in-house system in Excel spreadsheets with some good guesses. This is how a lot of money gets lost for major deals.<p>With Paigo we handle 100% of the measurement and collection of SaaS customers’ usage for the business. SaaS business can see their customers’ usage within 10 minutes, because all they need to do is give us read access to their cloud account. Since we pull the lower level infra-data we can additionally give information like per tenant cost, and profit margin.<p>Matt and I came to this project after we built similar internal billing systems at previous jobs and we realized how error-prone these systems can be—one incident might have even undercharged a client by a few million dollars! We also realized there was no solution which integrated directly to a backend system and handled the measurement and gathering of usage data as well as providing the end billing integration to platforms like stripe, AWS marketplace, or through ACH.<p>To get into the technical details Paigo has a few measurement systems to measure different forms of usage data: infrastructure-based, where we connect directly to cloud APIs then to slice-and-dice per tenant usage data; agent-based, where our agent is deployed into a runtime to gather usage like pod cpu time, memory, and file read write, along with any exported metrics that are prometheus compatible; and datastore-based, where we connect directly to datastores like S3, Kinesis, or log file. We require that the data in the datastore based approach adhere to a standard data format so we can process it. However this allows us to Pull, any custom metrics and dimensions directly from your Datastore.  All of this data is then processed and sent to our backend usage journal, where we store it in an append-only ledger pattern.<p>For clients to search, and aggregate their data into an end bill or to slice and dice their client’s cost and usage we have an API clients can use. We’re an API first company, which is why our demo can work with Retool—the demo is just a very thin skin over our API. The API is a NestJS based application, currently running in AWS Lambda with API-Gateway.<p>We bill based on invoiced revenue (surprise surprise its usage based) and we have a platform fee, roughly it breaks down to 1% of invoiced revenue on Paigo. Note that pricing is not currently transparent on our website. Our typical customers are mid-sized enterprises where an initial sales call is typically expected. However, we will be updating our main webpage soon to have some self-service options.<p>For a bit of deeper dive on the measurement engine we have some docs here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.paigo.tech&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.paigo.tech&#x2F;</a><p>Thanks for taking time to read!

We&#x27;ll keep the costs down to less than $500 per person for 3 nights.<p>For more social proof before you join me on a trip, you can click through my profile on the trip page above to see my LinkedIn work history as an early engineer at Plaid and most recently the founder of a 70+ person company (Tremendous).',NULL,NULL,NULL,'[33348908, 33347251, 33346256, 33345979, 33349348, 33346841, 33346502, 33347800, 33349300, 33348152, 33348976, 33348549, 33357272, 33346386, 33345039, 33349580, 33348576, 33345925, 33349064, 33348838, 33347062]','https://villagersapp.com/','63','Show HN: Villagers – A group travel app',NULL,'52','2022-10-28 10:00:45','2022-10-28 10:00:45'),(33344966,NULL,'SleekEagle','story','1666797269',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'[33355945]','https://www.assemblyai.com/blog/an-introduction-to-poisson-flow-generative-models/','8','Poisson Flow Generative Models – new image generation model inspired by physics',NULL,'2','2022-10-28 10:34:41','2022-10-28 10:34:41'),(33344993,NULL,'adg001','story','1666797325',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'[33346377, 33347665, 33350420]','https://dspinellis.github.io/unix-history-man/','30','Documented Unix facilities (across 93 major Unix releases)',NULL,'5','2022-10-28 09:56:17','2022-10-28 09:56:17'),(33345040,NULL,'metadat','story','1666797557',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'[33346302, 33346829, 33346166, 33345596, 33346478, 33345469, 33346705, 33348738, 33346180, 33347786, 33361223, 33346050, 33346388, 33350796, 33346557, 33346049, 33351918, 33346997, 33346513, 33352335, 33346316, 33346468, 33350367, 33353552, 33354462, 33350435, 33350860, 33348103, 33346408, 33346157, 33348651, 33347050, 33346031, 33345951, 33345323]','https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/User:Sakaki/Sakaki%27s_EFI_Install_Guide/Disabling_the_Intel_Management_Engine','518','Disabling the Intel Management Engine',NULL,'288','2022-10-28 09:56:10','2022-10-28 09:56:10'),(33345045,NULL,'tacker2000','story','1666797578',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'[33347656, 33349406, 33347156, 33348072, 33347381]','https://www.bbc.com/news/business-63403363','21','Made.com furniture website on brink of collapse',NULL,'11','2022-10-28 10:01:11','2022-10-28 10:01:11'),(33345054,NULL,'temple_os','story','1666797609',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'[33345055, 33348106, 33350858, 33349120, 33358546]','https://romanbird.github.io/sicp/','38','I made a course page for anyone interested in taking SICP in future',NULL,'9','2022-10-28 10:02:22','2022-10-28 10:02:22'),(33345421,NULL,'brrrrrm','story','1666798993',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'[33347084, 33346092, 33346421, 33346547, 33345485, 33346511, 33347522, 33347933, 33348555, 33346120, 33346149, 33346138, 33347793, 33347476, 33347304, 33351614, 33347191, 33347185, 33346565, 33350752, 33348726, 33348529, 33346292, 33348436, 33345931, 33346873, 33349437, 33354434, 33346717, 33346412, 33353066, 33348482, 33348732, 33346155, 33346057, 33348766, 33347040]','https://jott.live/markdown/py3.11_vs_3.8','365','Python 3.11 is faster than 3.8',NULL,'292','2022-10-28 09:57:08','2022-10-28 09:57:08'),(33345806,NULL,'bubblehack3r','story','1666800594',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'[33351483, 33356656, 33351305, 33351525, 33355700, 33352180, 33351796]','https://sysdig.com/blog/massive-cryptomining-operation-github-actions/','42','GitHub Actions being abused to run crypto mining',NULL,'7','2022-10-28 09:54:47','2022-10-28 09:54:47'),(33345867,NULL,'dghubble','story','1666800861',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'[33347562, 33348733, 33346703, 33356593, 33354216, 33350173, 33347230, 33346276, 33349623]','https://www.psdn.io/posts/systemd-shutdown-unit/','224','Writing systemd units that stop gracefully before shutdown',NULL,'53','2022-10-28 09:53:35','2022-10-28 09:53:35'),(33345940,NULL,'okfine','story','1666801187',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'[33368051, 33368647, 33368304, 33367388, 33368207, 33368117, 33367811, 33367637]','https://medium.com/@mijordan3/artificial-intelligence-the-revolution-hasnt-happened-yet-5e1d5812e1e7','37','Artificial Intelligence: The Revolution Hasn’t Happened Yet (2018)',NULL,'23','2022-10-28 06:24:54','2022-10-28 06:24:54'),(33345954,NULL,'skaldic','story','1666801246',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'[33350097, 33346998, 33346576, 33346580, 33346712, 33346789, 33346530, 33345993, 33346206, 33347054, 33346555, 33349654, 33348095, 33347958, 33346719, 33350350, 33354204, 33347176, 33350296, 33348962, 33348857, 33349424, 33347787, 33346828, 33346963, 33350677, 33348734, 33346203, 33353647, 33351612, 33348139, 33348012, 33347217, 33347172, 33348658, 33346306, 33346607, 33346485, 33346393]','https://www.wired.com/1997/12/es-attention/','326','The currency of the new economy won\'t be money, but attention (1997)',NULL,'149','2022-10-28 10:22:17','2022-10-28 10:22:17'),(33346183,NULL,'npoturnak','story','1666802341','Nik and Jagjit here, founders of Idemeum (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.idemeum.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.idemeum.com&#x2F;</a>). We are excited to share our product with HN!<p>Idemeum is a SaaS platform that offers a single place to manage access to applications and infrastructure. We let businesses eliminate passwords for everything employees access: devices, applications, servers, and networks. Our cloud platform eliminates VPNs and allows access to applications and infrastructure from anywhere with a single click.<p>In industry terms, we combine Privileged Access Management (PAM), Identity and Access Management (IAM), and passwordless technologies.<p>In simpler terms: you install our mobile application, navigate to your SaaS idemeum tenant, scan a QR-code, and login with biometrics. Once you are in, you can access anything with a single click - SAML Single Sign-On apps, hosted on-premises apps, password apps, SSH servers, and more. There’s a quick overview here: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=-3StOlDjMrQ\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=-3StOlDjMrQ</a><p>We spent more than a decade in identity access management and threat detection at VMware, Facebook, and Cisco, building platforms to manage user access. That experience left us excited about two things: (1) kill passwords; (2) make things simple.<p>We started our company with the mission to eliminate passwords in the workplace. That’s important—80% of breaches involve passwords—but our vision gradually evolved into an all-in-one platform to manage employee access.<p>First we built Passwordless MFA, a mobile app that replaces passwords with biometrics and certificates. You can login into any company resource - SSO portal, Windows or Mac desktop, Wi-Fi, VPN - with a simple Face ID scan. But behind the scenes we use a lot of technology to make our MFA unphishable and secure (FIDO2, hardware-backed crypto, device attestation, and more).<p>Second, we added a full-featured Single Sign-On Identity Provider. It is a web and mobile portal to centralize access to all apps and infrastructure. Unlike other Identity Providers that focus only on SAML SaaS applications, we added all resources to the same portal, so you can access apps, servers, databases and more from the same place. Today we support hundreds of SAML integrations, offer account provisioning, RBAC, auditing, group management and more.<p>Next, we added a password vault. Companies asked us to add a password management capability to safely store credentials, share amongst employees, and autofill on websites. But unlike other password managers, we do not use a master password. Instead you login into your vault (on desktop or mobile) with mobile biometrics such as Face ID. The vault is end to end encrypted, and your passwords can not be seen in our cloud.<p>Last but not least, we realized that SSO for cloud applications is solving only part of the problem, as engineers need to access hosted apps and compute infrastructure. As a result we added a cloud proxy to our platform to offer remote access to on-premises applications and SSH servers. Not only do we provide connectivity, but also handle authentication, authorization and auditing for infrastructure access. For example, we replace SSH passwords and keys with short-lived certificates. We will release RDP access shortly, and will then start adding database access to our platform.<p>Security is critical for us - we have been prioritizing security from day one. We are open with how our system is architected, and published all designs on our docs portal (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.idemeum.com&#x2F;mobile-app-security.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.idemeum.com&#x2F;mobile-app-security.html</a>). We also conducted our first penetration test with Cure53 to validate our designs, crypto, and security principles. We are also SOC2 compliant.<p>We offer a free plan and would love your feedback if you give us a try: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;idemeum.com&#x2F;try\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;idemeum.com&#x2F;try</a>.<p>We would be very grateful to hear your feedback, ideas, and experiences from the identity and access management domain.

I&#x27;ve been following this advice. Recording many short entries over a day is very useful for me. I can easily find items for my performance review, leave notes for myself, etc.<p><i>Questions</i>:<p>1. What is your workflow?<p>2. What tools do you use?<p>3. If you log to a text file, how do you format your entries?<p><i>My framework</i><p>Daily log vs. daily journal<p>For me, entries in a daily journal require deeper thought and reflection on what you have done, your goals, etc. Usually, journaling is done 1-2 times&#x2F;day. Conversely, entries in a daily log concern immediate actions and are done many times a day. However, your daily log could inform entries in your daily journal.<p>Daily log vs. a to-do list<p>For me, entries in a to-do list are only the things you need to do. Also, most to-do lists I&#x27;ve seen don&#x27;t store the timestamp of when a to-do item was created. Conversely, entries in a daily log are more diverse and are all timestamped. They may include to-do items but don&#x27;t have to. My entries are updates, notes, questions, and to-dos.<p>My log is a markdown file, which I edit in Sublime Text. I created Espanso [1] shortcuts to add timestamped entries. E.g., &quot;zzq&quot; expands to &quot;[2022-10-26 10:45:24]: Question []:&quot; and &quot;zzn&quot; expands to &quot;[2022-10-26 10:45:56]: Note:&quot;.

We are Andres and Edgar and we are building MovingLake (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;movinglake.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;movinglake.com</a>). We are creating real-time, bidirectional data connectors which aim to solve automated ETL (eg moving data from an API to Snowflake), reverse ETL (we pipe the data straight to your CRM instead of going through the data warehouse),  and transactional integrations (e.g. for an ERP integration) in one swoop. Polling, webhooks, websockets, REST, GraphQL, SOAP—we merge it all into one reliable, replayable, real-time data stream which can be sent anywhere.<p>Here are two demos: Whatsapp to Google Sheets (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;Qy4eInGgIhw\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;Qy4eInGgIhw</a>) and Postgres to Webhooks (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;cmrkUan8o1w\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;cmrkUan8o1w</a>).<p>Moving data around is still difficult and a pain. Companies spend thousands of hours and lots of money making data pipelines. General solutions are difficult in that there are too many sources and too many destinations. It also entails a ton of schlep that no one really wants to deal with. At the same time, the API &#x2F; data connector market is vast. Even when there are already multiple billion-dollar companies in the space, we continue to see big verticals unattended.<p>We previously worked at big tech as well as have been CTOs of Series B startups in Latam. We got into this problem when we had the experience of paying for pre-built data connectors, but at the same time having to do custom integrations to the API, at which point it didn’t make sense to have a paid data connector. After a few paid connectors and manual connectors we thought that there should be an event-driven, realtime data connector company which could solve all of our API integration needs in one go.<p>We also are not huge believers in operationalizing the data warehouse, i.e. the trend to use the data warehouse as a processing tool out of which data is extracted and pushed to other systems. Since data warehouses are built on an OLAP frame of mind, we think using it as a computation source for automated workflows is not the best idea. At MovingLake we propose using rather realtime connectors with a transformation pipeline which is specifically designed to do these things.<p>We combine polling with webhooks and websockets to provide a single reliable stream. If there&#x27;s websockets, we use them. If there&#x27;s webhooks we use them. If there&#x27;s only GET endpoints then we poll as fast as the API lets us. Either way we ensure you&#x27;ll get the data as fast as possible.<p>We provide destination adapters so that this data can be sent anywhere to as many destinations as you want for the same price. We provide CDC (Change Data Capture) plugins for databases to pull data as it is written and then send it anywhere. We also provide automatic JSON to SQL converters with Schema Evolution.<p>On our roadmap we still have to add the data transformation layer as well as add support for more bidirectional connectors.<p>“Get started” on our home page takes you to a “book a demo” thing, but there’s an open beta at <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.movinglake.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;app.movinglake.com</a> which everyone is welcome to try out. Everything is free for now, though eventually we’ll have to charge. Although we wanted to charge a standard fee per event extracted, this would have tied our hands to deliver tougher-to-build connectors. So most of our connectors are charged at $0.00004 per event, but some which include scraping are charged higher (we want to be very explicit about which connectors are charged differently).<p>Please let us know what you think!

For example, I was hiking with a friend the other day who has an S22 and he snapped a gorgeous photo from the top of the hill. But something seemed off with the clouds - it shaped slightly, but surely, different than what I observed with my naked eyes. It&#x27;s like being in an uncanny valley.<p>Also, most photos that I see people take with their phones have the saturation way too intense than in real life. I believe they are taking HDR photos but the auto-balancing act of the HDR tones is just not quite right. \nSame goes for the blurring effect. The depth of field achieved by phones are so artificial and unnatural that it throws me off a lot. It just flattens everything behind the subject and gives the same amount of blur. But depth of field doesn&#x27;t work like that in real life!<p>Phones&#x27; default behavior should be to capture the photo as true to real life as possible and then maybe if the user wants to be
